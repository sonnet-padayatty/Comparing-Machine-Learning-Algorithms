ANALYSIS OF BACK PAIN USING MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS
# Abstract
The project analyzes the information about subjects suffering from lower back pain. Our aim is
to classify subjects according to the type of lower back pain they experience, using a collection
of numerical and categorical clinical indicators. The response categories provide a clinically
meaningful binary classification of lower back pain, named as “Nociceptive” & “Neuropathic”.
This project is targeted to create an efficient machine learning technique which identifies the
pain diagnosis required for each patient. As the target variable in this particular dataset is not
continuous, we can apply variety of classification models that are good at prediction. Due to the
availability of various classifiers, it is our duty to find the best one from the collection and fit the
optimal model for this dataset. Once the best model is found, the prediction for future
observations can be done easily. The best model is fitted to a test data and the accuracy of the
model is estimated. If the performance of the model is acceptable in test data, then the
interpretation of rules used by the best model to predict the response variable is analyzed. This
may help us to find out hidden relationships between the predictor and response variables.
